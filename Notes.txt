Procedure to perform fault injection quickly!

1. Run the mobatsim project. Let the simulation get completed.
2. Now Go to the opened project in simulink named Mobatsim.slx.
3. Click on the vehicles that you want to inject fault in. (in this case choose 2 and 6)
4. Now go to the longitudnal and lateral speed controllers and then to the longitudnal speed control.
5. In the shown model, now insert the Band limited white noise after the reference speed block.
6. Now save the project and go the matlab editor section. Prepare and run the project again in order to collect the datset.

This was the most simple way to inject fault in the vichles during simulation.

There are other procedures that need to be and will be performed like
1. Changing starting and destinaton points
2. Debugging the simulation and vieweing the vehicle states according to the changes
3. setting a conditional breakpoint at various positions in order to debug it
4. Changing the parameter of the vehicles lateral controllers
5. Changing the type of path planner
6. Debugging through all the system block and evaluate the execution order
